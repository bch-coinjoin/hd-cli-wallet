# Pedigree

This code repository was original forked from [slp-cli-wallet](https://github.com/christroutner/slp-cli-wallet). That repository was a command-line wallet for working with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and SLP tokens. It was an HD wallet, and it depended on early versions of [bch-js](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-js) and [bch-api](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-api).

From that fork, the code was customized to work with [colab-coinjoin-api](https://github.com/bch-coinjoin/colab-coinjoin-api). This command-line wallet is intended to be used to prototype commands that will eventually be integrated into the [electron-bch-coinjoin-wallet](https://github.com/bch-coinjoin/electron-bch-coinjoin-wallet) desktop wallet.
